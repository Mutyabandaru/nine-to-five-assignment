/* Database Exploration â€” Tables, Columns, and Relationships
Tables and Columns
annual_2016
Columns: id, series_id, year, period, value, foot_note, original_file
Contains annual employment/earnings data for 2016 keyed by series_id.

datatype
Columns: data_type_code, data_type_text
Describes the type of data captured (e.g., employment, payroll, hours).

footname
Columns: footnote_code, footnote_text
Provides textual explanations for footnotes referenced in facts.

industry
Columns: industry_code, naics_code, publishing_status, industry_name, display_level, selectable, sort_sequence
Holds industry identifiers and classification details.

january_2017
Columns: id, series_id, year, period, value, foot_note, original_file
Contains monthly data (January 2017) analogous to annual_2016.

period
Columns: unspecified, but examples include codes like M01, JAN, January
Holds period definitions (month codes and labels).

seasonal
Columns: industry_code, seasonal_text
Contains seasonality descriptions linked to industries.

series
Columns: series_id, supersector_code, industry_code, data_type_code, seasonal, series_title, footnote_codes, begin_year, begin_period, end_year
Serves as the bridge linking facts to descriptive metadata (industry, data type, seasonality). The primary key (series_id) joins to fact tables.

supersector
Columns: supersector_code, supersector_name
Provides grouping of industries into broader sectors for reporting.

Relationships and Schema Structure
The fact tables (annual_2016, january_2017) contain observed values linked by series_id to the series table.

The series table is central and connects to:

industry via industry_code

datatype via data_type_code

supersector via supersector_code

Further classification details (e.g., seasonal adjustments, footnotes) augment the data for interpretation.

period and seasonal tables provide descriptive contexts for timing and seasonality respectively.

--Summarize Your Results:
-- 1. During which time period did production and nonsupervisory employees fare better?
-- Production and nonsupervisory employees fared better in January 2017 compared to 2016. The average weekly hours worked in January 2017 was about 36.06 hours, reflecting more consistent work hours. The total weekly payroll in January 2017 was $1,839,113,368.80, which suggests strong compensation during this period. These figures indicate better conditions compared to annual 2016 data.

/*2. In which industries did production and nonsupervisory employees fare better?
The "Total private" industry had the highest average weekly hours and payroll for production and nonsupervisory employees, showing that this broad sector offered better employment and pay conditions.

The "Fitness and recreational sports centers" industry had the lowest average weekly hours suggesting this industry fared worse in terms of hours worked.
This contrast highlights that employees in large private sectors had better work and pay conditions than those in niche industries.*/

--Question3: Now that you have explored the datasets, is there any data or information that you wish you had in this analysis?

/*While the dataset is comprehensive, it would be helpful to have:

More granular demographic data (age, ethnicity) to understand disparities within production and nonsupervisory employees.

Data on regional/geographic differences to see how employment conditions vary across locations.

More detailed time series data beyond just 2016 and January 2017 to understand trends.

Information on part-time vs full-time status to better contextualize hours worked and payroll.*/
